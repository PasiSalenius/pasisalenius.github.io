  <h2 id="transporter">Transporter</h2>
<p>This policy applies to the <a href="https://freshbits.fi/apps/transporter">Transporter</a> journey planner app for iPhone.</p>
<h4 id="information-we-collect">Information we collect</h4>
<p>When starting the app for the first time on a new device, you are asked if you want your favorite lines and stops to be sent to our servers. Line and stop identifiers are matched to current traffic information such as disruption alerts, delays on lines and news bulletins, and you are sent notifications for these events. You may choose not to send your favorite lines and stops to our servers at all.</p>
<p>You are also asked if you wish to receive notifications for delays and disruptions on your planned route. If enabled, data from the currently selected route is automatically sent to our servers. This information consists of line and trip identifiers, departure and arrival location coordinates and times. About an hour after the route arrival time this information is deleted from our servers. If notifications for route delays are not enabled, no information about your routes is ever sent to our servers.</p>
<p>Enabling reminders for stop arrivals, identifiers for the selected line, stop and departure time are sent to our servers. This information is used to monitor the realtime arrival time of the line and send you a notification at the correct time. The information is either deleted at the time of sending the notification, or one month after enabling a repeating reminder.</p>
<p>We store a token for every instance of the Transporter app. These tokens are received from Apple and used to deliver <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/APNSOverview.html">push notifications</a> to users&rsquo; devices. The tokens are never used for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>Finally, our servers also collect aggregate usage numbers for the different functions, such as new app registrations and activations of reminders, purely for simple statistics and service health monitoring purposes.</p>
<h4 id="accessing-changing-and-deleting-your-information">Accessing, changing and deleting your information</h4>
<p>If you do not use the Transporter app on your iPhone for 30 days, all information related to your app instance is deleted from our servers. Next time you launch the app, the same data is synched back to our servers, according to the settings described above.</p>
<p>You can access and change your information using the Transporter client. Deleting the app from your phone will lead to deleting of all information related to you and your device within 30 days.</p>
<h4 id="security">Security</h4>
<p>Various security measures are implemented to keep your information secure. All communications between the Transporter client and server require HTTPS with certificate pinning.</p>
<h4 id="external-parties">External parties</h4>
<p>The app relies on the external <a href="https://digitransit.fi">Digitransit API</a> provided by <a href="https://www.hsl.fi">HSL</a> and the <a href="https://www.liikennevirasto.fi">Finnish Transport Agency</a>. They have their own independent privacy policies.</p>
<h2 id="areenax">AreenaX</h2>
<p>This policy applies to the <a href="https://freshbits.fi/apps/areenax">AreenaX</a> media player for Mac and Apple TV.</p>
<h4 id="information-we-collect-1">Information we collect</h4>
<p>The AreenaX apps only communicate to <a href="http://developer.yle.fi/">Yle API</a> for loading TV program metadata and downloading media streams. Any user information collected by Yle is explained in their own <a href="https://yle.fi/aihe/yleisradio/tietosuoja">privacy policy</a>.</p>
<p>Locally on your device the apps store a list of identifiers for programs and series that have been set as favorites. This information is used to display these programs to the user separately from other content. Information about favorite programs and series is never sent out a server or any third party.</p>
<h2 id="website">Website</h2>
<p>This policy applies to this website at freshbits.fi.</p>
<h4 id="information-we-collect-2">Information we collect</h4>
<p>The freshbits.fi website itself does not collect user information. It does not set cookies on your browser.</p>
<h4 id="external-parties-1">External parties</h4>
<p>The static website is hosted at <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub.com</a>. GitHub has their own independent <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/">privacy policy</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare.com</a> is used as a CDN for security safeguards, reduced latency and basic statistics on visitor counts. Cloudflare has their own independent <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/">privacy policy</a>.</p>
